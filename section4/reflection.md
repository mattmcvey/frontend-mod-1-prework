## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It certainly felt a bit different. It really helped me stay on track and not get distracted, which can be a big problem for me. The idea that I had a count down to a break helped my keep my mind on track and focused. I think I utilized my time better and was more productive.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found estimating my time was a bit more difficult than I had expected it to be. I for sure got better with each try but either way I was being more productive and focused throughout the entire process.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a way to store data like an array but it differs in the fact that an object utilizes key value pairs that help further define data that is being stored.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - I think an array would be best here as all we need here is student names and nothing further to define them.
  * List of states and their capitals
  - An object would be handy here as you could use the state as the key and the capital as the value.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - An array seems best here as it is simply a list of things with no associated data mentioned.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - An array should work here as well as again its just a list of accounts with no mention of other data attached.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - An object would be helpful here. You could either list each student as a key with the cohort as the value or you could do the cohorts as the key and an array of students as the value.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - An object would be best to store the ingredient and associated ammount as the value.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - An array is probably best as we are just listing all favorite restaurants and no additional data is needed or mentioned.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I think with the fantasy football app you could certainly have keys that represent the position and the value would be the player associated with it. The same could go for the player and the team they are associated with.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Not at the moment!
