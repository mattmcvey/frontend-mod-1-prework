## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
As far as asking questions is concerned I could surely get better has raising my hand when I need help. I have been notorious for pushing along alone and trying to figure things out without too much help. I think that I can surely find a happy medium and ask questions sooner. It will be something I will be actively woking on as I grow here at Turing!

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I think this worked out well for me. As I mentioned in the prior question this is generally how I go about learning, as in, I like to dig through the internet and see what I can find. At the same time I do enjoy some guidance so I think this was balanced very nicely for me.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is when certain actions are executed based on whether certain conditions evaluate to true or false. One example could be if its cold outside I will wear a jacket if not I will not. I think it programming you could point to a password as a situation where this applies. If the passwords meets the outlined requirements it will be accepted and if not an error message will likely come up telling you what is wrong.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You van add multiple conditions to and if statement by using else if statements. The program will start at the top with the if statement and if the conditions are met it will perform its specified action if not it will move on to the next if else statement and test those conditions. If those are met it will perform that action if not it will move on to the next if else or else statement and that continues until it comes to the condition it meets.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical operators are a good way to check if 2 conditions are met using the && operator. Both conditions need to be met in order for it to move forward or be considered false. If you are only looking for one to be the || operator is a good choice as it only requires one of the two be true in order to take action.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Not a ton of questions here. They make sense to me at the moment.
