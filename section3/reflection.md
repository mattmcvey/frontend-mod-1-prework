## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I think one point that really stuck with me was the idea of a growth mindset in general. It was really hard for me to grasp at first as I was of the mindset that you were born with you certain ability or intelligence and there was no changing or improving that. I have since learned that is not true at all and we all have the ability to change and improve ourselves in any way we want!

I also think that the idea that you don't know something or that you are failing is ok. Of course I hate to fail like everyone else but it used to be the case that i had a very hard time reconciling the fact that I did not immediately succeed. It has been a long process in order to learn that failing is just another opportunity to grow, learn and better oneself.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I certainly think that I take the approach of persistence will pay off. The idea of getting knocked down and getting back up and learning from what knocked you down is very important. Sometimes there are big lessons to be learned and other times it is as simple as just trying again to keep pushing.

I think I could be better at setting myself milestones and tracking my progress. I think I am good at self evaluation and being honest with where I am at but not so good at recognizing the growth and milestones I have achieved. I think that is an important part of having a growth mindset that I could be better at.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
I think about when I look at my fantasy football app on ESPN that it would make sense to group a members team using an array. To say that player x has player x, y ,z on their team and that would be easily assigned and tracked using an array.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is basically a function that can change or alter an existing array. Essentially a method is a function that is easily called upon using keywords and in this case it is related to an array. I think of them as shortcuts to do things to an array that would take a function if we were to do it ourselves and it is so often that we use these functions someone did us a favor be neatly packing them in a quick keyword.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop gives us access to elements of an array or string quickly and all at once and as many times as we may need that data. I think anytime you are looking to use multiple pieces of data from an array or even looking for specific pieces of data loops are very handy, especially if you don't know exactly what is in the array or where the data is located. If you know what the array looks like and you are only looking for one piece of data you may not need a loop as you can pull the data directly or using a method.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
I would say that if we had group of toys in a box and we wanted to see all of the toys in that box plainly laid out a loop would be a way for us to look at each toy individually.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Nothing that I can think of at the moment!
