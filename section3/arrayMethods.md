pop - This method removes the last element of an array and returns that element. This method edits the original array and will change the actual length.

shift - This method has the exact opposite effect of .pop, it removes the first element of an array. This method will change the original array length.

unshift - This method will insert values at the beginning of an array. This method allows for the addition of multiple elements at the same time that will be added in the same order they are passed to the method.

push - This method will add elements to the end of the array adding to the overall length.
