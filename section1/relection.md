## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I think the SuperLearner helped reinforce the idea that learning is a life long journey and not a goal to be met. This is a mindset that I have had to adjust to recently. When I was in school I believed I just needed to meet my goals of getting certain grades and was not so worried about actual growth. As I have gotten older I have learned that continuous growth is super important and I think that sentiment was very much so echoed in this article. I think I could do a better job of reading more often. Currently I probably get in a couple books a year and think a pretty substantial increase in the volume of reading I do could certainly help my growth and learning process. I also tend to have a power through it mind set and have a hard time take frequent breaks, another area for me to improve.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Numbers - Any whole integer or number containing a float or decimal place
String - Anything contained in quotes is considered a string
Boolean - True or false or yes or no type situations

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// is the way to indicate comments. Generally used to indicate what a certain piece of code is doing or meant for.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a way to store data to be referred to later. It is a way of naming a piece of data in a relevant way to easily access and use at some point. That data can be reassigned or updated based on how things change.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
In the fantasy football app I think there would be variables that would house things like player position, player name and team. They would all be holding a string as their data type.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is the combining of 2 or more otherwise separate pieces of data to make a new piece of data.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
I would that when I receive an email from fantasy football app regarding who has been dropped and added by another team I am sure that the email is being populated using concatenation in place of what player was added and by what team.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I think git is still pretty confusing to me. I would clarification on when to use what command in the terminal.
