I was able to solve the ceasar cipher code problem but some of my notes are below.
- create a second alphabet list that would take into account the shift number from the parameters
- once that was created it was as simple as looping over the input string and finding each elements index in the original alphabet and using that as the index number for the second alphabet and appending each letter to a string.
